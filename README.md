# Dutch Government API portal

> üë©‚Äçüî¨ This project is an early stage **Proof of Concept**, which means functionality and documentation might be broken, missing or flat out wrong.

A website to advertise the APIs provided by governments and public administrations in the Netherlands.

## Adding content

### Adding an organisation

Add a file with the following file pattern: `/apis/{organisationName}/index.md`, and make sure the title of the file is the name of the organisation.

### Adding an API

Add a file with the following file pattern: `/apis/{organisation-name}/{api-name}.md`. The following front-matter variables are available to be set:

```yaml
---
OpenAPI: https://api.data.amsterdam.nl/afval/swagger/
licence: cc0
url: https://api.data.amsterdam.nl/afval/
---
```

Make sure to add the API to the organisations' index, since there is no automatic inclusion.
